    <p>When I first fantasized about becoming a professional opera singer, my role models for the 'perfect singing life'
       included famous baritone singers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a>,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Finley">Gerald Finley</a>,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Fischer-Dieskau">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a>,
       people who spent their days singing in outstanding theatres, from the Metropolitan Opera to La Scala
       to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London, and similar venues.</p>
    <p>I had <b>no idea</b> how astronomically lucky these guys were (not to mention hard-working!).</p>
    <p>Now that I am better aware of the industry, my goals lie in simply performing major roles that I've come to adore, hopefully with reputable companies that can afford some luxuries.</p>
    <p>The world has become a drastically different place since I first dreamed of singing for a living.
       I had no idea that I would one day be living in one of the most expensive cities on the planet.
       My schools taught me how to sing very well, and I get paid good salaries for the gigs I do,
        but there simply aren't enough hours out there to make it practical in the long term by itself.</p>
    <p>February 2016, enter coding. I realized that there are a couple of perks to getting into this industry now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web development is an industry reliant on engineers who can quickly achieve fluency in many different languages, a skill I'm already very well acquainted with.</li>
      <li>Those engineers have bosses who depend on their employees to have creative gifts to solve their daily conundrums, something I am not lacking as a musical artist.</li>
      <li>This industry is predicted to grow exponentially in the near future with the number of available jobs expanding, not decreasing.</li>
      <li>The epicenter of this business is in San Francisco, a city I already live near to.</li>
      <li>The jobs that are out there pay well above the national average, at rates that are several multiples of what I currently make just with singing.</li>
      <li>Most pivotally of all, it is actually a feasible feat to attain a job within this industry that is truly remote. If I code well enough, I can take my coding career alongside my opera career, from auditions in New York to productions in Minnesota, Los Angeles, Italy, Spain, Japan, and the rest of the globe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be able to sustain my opera career with a fulfilling side-career that will allow me to afford all the things in life that everybody wants, like retirement, savings, vacations, etc... that's what I'm really after.</p>

    <p> Following Galvanize, I'd like to work for companies who care about my deepest interests, such </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Language learning (DuoLingo is a favorite of mine),</li>
      <li>Operatic/Musical industries,</li>
      <li>Companies which encourage others to become more physically active through their apps,</li>
      <li>the sky's the limit!</li>
    </ul>

    </aside>

    <p>Within the next five years, here are a couple of goals I have vividly in my head:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work with a company that shares my interests</li>
      <li>Hike the Pacific Crest Trail, ideally around '19</li>
      <li>Acquire a full rack for alpine climbing, and learn how to do it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Within my lifetime, I want to perform some of the greatest operatic roles for baritones that exist, while simultaneously earning a good living from coding.</p>
    <p>Oh, and I want to summit Everest before I die. No biggie.</p>
    <h4>HURRAY FOR THE FUTURE!</h4>
